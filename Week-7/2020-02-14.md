## 다른 view render하기
#### 같은 디렉토리 안에 있는 view
```ruby
# app/views/staffs/posts/new.html.erb
<%= render 'form' %>
# => app/views/staffs/posts/_form.html.erb
```
#### 다른 디렉토리 안에 있는 view
```ruby
# app/views/staffs/pages/show.html.erb
<%= render 'staffs/posts/post' %>
# => app/views/staffs/posts/_post.html.erb
```

## Time.current vs. Time.now
#### [Time.current](https://apidock.com/rails/Time/current/class)
`Time.zone` 또는 `config.time_zone`이 설정되어 있으면 `Time.zone.now`를, 그렇지 않으면 `Time.now`를 리턴한다.  
```ruby
Time.current
# => Mon, 17 Feb 2020 02:28:37 KST +09:00
```
#### [Time.now](https://apidock.com/ruby/Time/now/class)
현재 시간을 리턴한다.  
```ruby
Time.now
# => 2020-02-17 02:28:37 +0900
```

## [Rails Time Zones](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/its-about-time-zones)
#### Rails App의 3가지 time zones과 예시
- system time
- application time
- database time
```ruby
# This is the time on my machine, also commonly described as "system time"
> Time.now
=> 2015-07-04 17:53:23 -0400

# Let's set the time zone to be Fiji
> Time.zone = "Fiji"
=> "Fiji"

# But we still get my system time
> Time.now
=> 2015-07-04 17:53:37 -0400

# However, if we use `zone` first, we finally get the current time in Fiji
> Time.zone.now
=> Sun, 05 Jul 2015 09:53:42 FJT +12:00

# We can also use `current` to get the same
> Time.current
=> Sun, 05 Jul 2015 09:54:17 FJT +12:00

# Or even translate the system time to application time with `in_time_zone`
> Time.now.in_time_zone
=> Sun, 05 Jul 2015 09:56:57 FJT +12:00

# Let's do the same with Date (we are still in Fiji time, remember?)
# This again is the date on my machine, system date
> Date.today
=> Sat, 04 Jul 2015

# But going through `zone` again, and we are back to application time
> Time.zone.today
=> Sun, 05 Jul 2015

# And gives us the correct tomorrow according to our application's time zone
> Time.zone.tomorrow
=> Mon, 06 Jul 2015

# Going through Rails' helpers, we get the correct tomorrow as well
> 1.day.from_now
=> Mon, 06 Jul 2015 10:00:56 FJT +12:00
```
#### Don't use
```ruby
* Time.now
* Date.today
* Date.today.to_time
* Time.parse("2015-07-04 17:05:37")
* Time.strptime(string, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z")
```
#### Do use
```ruby
* Time.current
* 2.hours.ago
* Time.zone.today
* Date.current
* 1.day.from_now
* Time.zone.parse("2015-07-04 17:05:37")
* Time.strptime(string, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z").in_time_zone
```
